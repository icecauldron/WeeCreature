Perhaps we could do a bingo format for the middle name... where the community puts in a name they would like and then it's drawn from a bowl [would prefer to look at the child and let the child pick it somehow]. 
I'm less likely to be so generous with the first name. Willing to negotiate as time progresses, however. In ABC order, not in preference order. [would prefer that you solely pick the first name according to what you feel after birth]
