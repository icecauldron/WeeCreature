Given the amount of anxiety around infants and childrearing, it appears that the industry and medical professionals tend to be overly careful in their statements. It's probable that it's not too complicated, given at least 300 generations of humans. As such, the common markers for when an infant "should" hit a learning landmark are conservative (paraphrased from selentelechia). Like all other human behavior, diversity and variance are to be expected.

[Delaying Formal Arithmetic Instruction](https://www.triviumpursuit.com/articles/research_on_teaching_math.php) There is significant evidence to suggest that arithmetic instruction can be rather informal and incidental until a child enters puberty, with little loss of efficacy.  
**"When we love each other well, we help each other parent well."** On Attachment, from Sue Johnson: "When we feel securely attached to our partner, we tend to find it easier to be good parents, to provide a safe haven and secure base. Our kids then learn positive ways to deal with their emotions and connect with others...one of the best things you can do for your child is to create a loving relationship with your partner." Rand Conger et al found that strength of connection between parents predicted how children related to romantic partners years later.
