I think there needs to be at least two children to get the full range of the following learned abilities that single children often do not learn as early on (children should be no further than 4 years apart):\
    - socialization, negotiation, fairness, objective reasoning, empathy, construction/building skills (quicker to understand the dynamics of teamwork)
